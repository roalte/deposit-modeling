 Prediction of clients total deposit value

## TASK:
You need to build and describe a model, where the target variable is monthly changes in the volume of the market for deposits of clients in the Russian Federation (in rubles), which will be explainable from the point of view of economic logic. Additionally, you need to build a target forecast for 1.18 - 12.18.

## DATA:
The .xls file contains data on changes in the volume of deposits of individuals in rubles in the Russian Federation, as well as rates on the product, related products and macroeconomic indicators. As explanatory factors, you can use both the indicators presented in the database, and independently found indicators (for example, on the website of Rosstat or the Central Bank). 

## MODEL:
Evaluation can be carried out using any models (methods and algorithms), however, they must show both good quality in terms of describing relationships, and high predictive power for the future period. Also, the model should provide dependencies consistent with the economic logic.
